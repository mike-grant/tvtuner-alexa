##  Disclaimer
I've been kindly asked by the people over at JustWatch to include a disclaimer regarding the **unofficial** and **unsupported** usage of their API.

The work of many developers went and is still going into the development and maintenance of the data and the API. JustWatch's main business is to operate a [streaming guide](https://www.justwatch.com/) with apps for iOS and Android. They offer the data for business intelligence and marketing. Therefore it is prohibited to use the API for commercial use (consumer service, data science, business intelligence, etc.). It is ok to use the API for private projects, but please be respectful with your API calls to not put too much load on the API. The API is not supported in any way and will change frequently without warning.

If you would like to work with JustWatch and use the data/API please get in contact with them via [info@justwatch.com](mailto:info@justwatch.com). Currently, JustWatch can only work with bigger partners and clients.
JustWatch is also hiring: https://www.justwatch.com/us/talent and has some interesting open source projects:
